# iBeaconFullExample
iBeacon App Demo referred to speech for DroidCon 2015: http://it.droidcon.com/2015/sessions/experimenting-monitoring-and-proximity-techniques-using-android-potential-and-ibeacon-devices/

This Demo contains the implementation of the Monitoring and Ranging Features of iBeacons.
Is used also to work as Indoor Location and Way Finding.

I've made the app in order to test the two SDKs Estimote and AltBeacon.
You can find implemented for each SDK all the functions except monitoring which is made only using Estimote.
